# Networks of DC: An Internet Infrastructure Field Guide

Following the Seeing Networks  work of Ingrid Burrington in NYC, this project seeks to map the network infrastructure of Washington D.C. We welcome contributions and thank the volunteers who helped to get this started. 
 
As a starting point, the volunteers collected primary and second data about the DC's network infrastructure. This data included information about telecoms, camera systems, street markings, and manhole covers.
